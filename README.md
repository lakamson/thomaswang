  I'm working on an immunization app with my co-founder Katherine Sistrunk, called [VaxNow](https://vaxnow.org). I'm also working on my student developer platform [DormDev](https://dormdev.com) and plan on releasing a student verification API service. 2020 has been a tough year for the world and me personally, but I am excited about these projects and :crossed_fingers: to their development.
